Terrain-generation in OpenGL (short: OGLTG)


TODO
======================
1)Rework the mesh generation
2)Add a more user-friendly interface (buttons etc.), maybe even transition to Qt for the UI
3)Add multithreading
4)Add plant generation module using randomly generated fractal trees and bushes
5)Add particle system for water and weather simulation
6)Add wind (shaders should do the trick)
